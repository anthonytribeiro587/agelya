 * assign) booking path requires at least one active employee to exist, or
 * every booking attempt fails with a misleading "slot already booked" error
 * (ported from the SaaS repo, where this was found via a real support
 * ticket: a business had 0 employees and every booking attempt failed).
 * Auto-creating the owner as the first active employee at signup closes
 * that gap. Self-hosted has no existing-business backfill to run — every
 * self-hosted install is a single business, so this only matters for new
 * registrations going forward.
